## **Academic Interests**
<br>

***Cloud Computing and Beyond.***

Cloud has been around for quite a few time now in the Industry and it has been empowering many Organizations to Trasform and Evolve from a Tradition way of approaching things to viewing every Technological Step from a different prespective. I am inclined towards conceptual and implenetational aspects of Cloud Technologies for arising Challenges amongst various players from the Insudtry. This includes : *Cloud-based soltuions for Healthcare Organizations, IoT enable implenetation of Cyber Physical System in Production Industries and Automated Contact Center Solutions in Cloud*

***DevOps Engineering***

DevOps has evolved as an Modern Standard of Development in the Industry. Every Tech Gaint if not atleast 3 out of 5 have started to aapt and embrace the culture of DevOps thereby Thriving towards faster and better Innovation. Organisations have evidently reported a **faster pace** at evolving and improving products comparing to the days of traditional development and operational processes. I am keenly involved into learing and adapting to DevOps culture and practices.

***Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning***

It's has become an Integral part of every Development process to look room of implementing **AI in their product. AI is almost everywhere, in every product.** Equally the **Data Standards** - a mutifold jump that came along. With Data generated every second the approach to Data Models and implementation of Machine Learning has become a basic routine. I am interested to dig deep into all aspects of Artifical Intelligence, it's ingration in Applications and Services and the Machine Learning approaches to the evolving Modern Data.

## **What else, if it matters to you?**

I was born and raised in an urban City - Chennai of Thamizh Nadu, an Indian state rich in culture and diversity. My father is a Master in Electrical Engineering and is involved with Otis Elevator India. We speak a dilect of Dravidian language, known as Thamizh (regarded as World's First Language). My district is known for various Iconic Places : Marina Beach, Chennai Port, Beaches of East Coast Road, OMR-IT Highway and much more.

I love **Formula One** and I am a **Lewis Hamilton** Fan boy. I enjoy riding motorbikes (mostly fast-yet-careful racing). I play cricket; I am a wicketkeeper. That view of the game from behind the stumps is extraordinary. I have occasionally played football; I am a goalkeeper. I love beach time (The Arabian sea is my neighbour). Watching movies / series on weekends has always been there since my undergrad studies (sometimes, I do binge-watch). In addition to all these fun stuff, I am also interested in psychology, philosophy, spirituality, stock and economics.
