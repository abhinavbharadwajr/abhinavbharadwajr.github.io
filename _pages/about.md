**Aspiring** Multi-Cloud DevOps Engineer. I Like to Solve day-to-day Challenges from the Real-World, Develop Digital Solutions.

Hobbies if you ask :
  - I Love hackintoshing and the most favorited and popular subreddit that I go to is [r/hachintosh](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/).
  - Music has been my bestfriend since like forever. I Heal, Breath, Run, Code and Sleep with Music, espiecially Electronic.
  - Book Reading is my second favorite thing to Music and I have always wanted to build a huge Rack for a personally curated Library of my own.  

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
