<h2>Symptom Analysis and Disease Prognostication using Machine Learning and Big Data</h2>

Developed along with Mr. [Kingston M](https://www.instagram.com/kingston_jamaika/), B.E., as part of our Finnal Semester Academic Project for out U.G. Programme in Engineering.

Basic implementaion of the Idea is to creat a visual Dialog to obtain "Sympotms" as input from the User and perform analysis using ML algorithms to Prognosticate what Disease the User might be suffering from.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/proj-ug-screen01.png" title="Visual Dialog Box for Input" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

Despite being a project of Small scale, the amount of Exprience and Exposure gained from this is Enormous as this was the First for both myself and Mr. Kingston working with Python as well as Machine Learning.
